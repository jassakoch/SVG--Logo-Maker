# SVG--Logo-Maker
## Description

This command-line application is designed to assist freelance web developers in generating simple logos for their projects without the need for a graphic designer. The application allows users to input text, choose text color, select a shape, and define the shape's color. Upon completion, the application generates an SVG file named logo.svg and prints "Generated logo.svg" in the command line. Opening the generated logo.svg file in a browser reveals a 300x200 pixel image that aligns with the specified criteria.
